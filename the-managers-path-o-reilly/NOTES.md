## Management 101 [&#8593;](#table-of-contents)
- 1-on-1 Meetings
    - For individual contributors, 1-on-1s with their managers should not be used as status meetings
    - Take initiative to craft an agenda for these meetings
- Training
    - _"Whether you are brand new to the workplace or 20 years into your career,
the onus of figuring out what you want to do, what you want to learn, and what
will make you happy rests on your shoulders."_

## Mentoring [&#8593;](#table-of-contents)
- Mentoring Interns
    - Many companies match new interns and grads with an existing employee as mentor
    - Usually a safe way of learning how to manage someone else
    - Listen beyond just language and pay attention to mentee's body language, eye contact
    - Set clear goals and milestones for interns, encourage research and problem solving on their own before seeking your help
- Mentoring Grads
    - _"Effective teams have good onboarding documents they provide to new hires.
Things like step-by-step guides to setting up their development environments,
learning how tracking systems work, and familiarizing themselves with the tools
they will need for the job are crucial for new hires."_
    - Don't forget to introduce new grads to your network within the company
- Beware the following red flags in managers:
    - undermines teammates, belittles mistakes
    - redoes the work of colleagues without warning
    - takes credit for team work
- Managing mentors
    - Figure out why a mentoring relationship is required in the first place
    - _"These programs can be nice, but often the mentor and mentee are
given very little guidance beyond the fact that they have been matched together."_
    - Recognise the additional effort required on the part of the mentor
    - Do not expect women to only mentor women, and men to only mentor men, people of color (PoC) to only mentor other PoC unless the purpose of the mentoring program is driven from a diversity focus
- Hiring Interns
    - Don't hire an intern who is not close to graduation - interns are a way to attract and retain top talent, look for someone closer to committing to their first full-time role
    - Hiring interns is relatively easier - you can push for hiring candidates from underrepresented groups

## Tech Lead [&#8593;](#table-of-contents)
- No one-size-fits-all definition for this role
    - Tech leads continue to write code, represent their team to management, vet feature delivery plans and deal with project management
    - _"A leader, responsible for a (software) development team, who spends at least 30 percent of their time writing code with the team."_ (Talking with Tech Leads, Patrick Kua)
-  Balancing technical feature delivery and project management tasks can be difficult at first
    - Avoid meetings which are not required
    - Ensure that others respect your team's focus and set up their calendar's accordingly
- Main roles of a tech lead:
    - Systems architect and business analyst: understand business requirements, translate into software. Devise architecture of the overall system and provide time estimates.
    - Project planner: identify priorities and find efficient ways of breaking down the work so that the team can work quickly.
    - Software developer and team leader: continue writing code, but not too much. Raise issues early without shame. Delegate work efficiently.
- Project planning
    - _"Doesn’t agile software development get rid of the need for project manage-
ment? No."_
    - _"Ultimately, the value of planning isn’t that you execute the plan perfectly,
that you catch every detail beforehand, or that you predict the future; it’s that you
enforce the self-discipline to think about the project in some depth before diving
in and seeing what happens."_
- Five step approach to project management
    - Break down deliverables into smaller blocks of work in a spreadsheet / Gantt chart
    - Push through unknowns until maximum value has been extracted from planning
    - Keep stakeholders updated of status throughout project, adjust plan as you go
    - Manage requirements changes, be clear about cost of changes
    - Revisit close to completion, perform a pre-mortem (an exercise where you go through all the things that could fail on the launch of this big project)
- Process Czars
    - _"The process czar believes that there is one true process that, if implemented correctly and followed as designed, will solve all of the team’s biggest problems."_
    - The opposite of this is a manager who realises that processes should meet the needs of the team and the project
    - Strive for self-regulating processes (i.e. automation)
    - Be honest and make it clear to the team that it is okay to fail
- Being a Great Tech Lead
    - _"It’s almost impossible to lead projects well when you don’t understand the architecture you’re changing."_
    - Be a team player, encourage others to learn the entire system and handle a variety of tasks
    - _"Determine which decisions must be made by you, which decisions should be delegated to others with more expertise, and which decisions require the whole team to resolve."_
    - _"Write design documents and get feedback on them from better writers. Write blog posts for your tech blog or your personal blog. Speak in team meetings, speak at meetups, and get practice standing up in front of an audience."_

## Managing People [&#8593;](#table-of-contents)

- Build trust and rapport using questions for a new report
    - How do you like to be praised, in public or in private?
    - What is your preferred method of communication for serious feedback?
Do you prefer to get such feedback in writing so you have time to digest it,
or are you comfortable with less formal verbal feedback?
    - Do you have any clear career goals that I should know about so I can help
you achieve them?
- Create a 30/60/90 day plan
    - Can help detect mishires quickly
    - Create realistic milestones based on prior hires, the current state of your technology and project, and the level of the person coming in
- _"A best practice in many engineering teams is to create a set of onboarding documents that are edited by every new hire as he gets up to speed"_
- Communicate working style and expectations around frequency of check-ins, deliverables etc.
- Get as much feedback as you can from the new hire in the first 90 days on established processes and potential improvements
- Schedule weekly 1-on-1s. Some questions to consider which can alter the frequency:
    - How often do you interact with this person offhand during the week?
    - How much coaching does this person need?
    - How much does this person push information up to you?
    - How stable or unstable are things in the team or the company?
- 1-on-1s can be of many types: formal to-do lists for discussion, informal catch-ups, occasional feedback / coaching sessions, and progress updates for managers of managers
- For each person you manage, maintain a running shared document of notes, takeaways, and to-dos from your 1-1s
- Creative, talented team members flourish with sufficient autonomy. Delegate effectively, but don't confuse this with abdicating responsibility
- Practical advice for delegating
    - Ensure team has valid goals to measure success against, use these to understand what details are important to dig into
    - Look at the version control systems or tickets for information, subscribe to any available alerts and examine the metrics
    - Different details are the priority at different project stages (good system design and goal-setting at first, progress details towards the end) - focus on the right detail at the right stage
    - Establish standards for code and systems (unit test coverage, linting, review of major technical decisions)
    - Treat openly shared information, good or bad, in a positive manner (for instance, a struggling colleague doesn't reveal this until late in the project)
- Adopt a culture of frequent feedback in the team, praising the good and correcting the bad without waiting for the annual reviews
    - Know your team: ask them about their ambitions, current level, strengths, weaknesses
    - Observe your team: try to recognise one positive trait in your colleague each week. Don't spend all your time trying to correct weakness as that can come off as undue criticism.
    - Give regular, lightweight feedback: positive feedback makes it easier for colleagues to digest corrective feedback when required
    - Provide coaching: Go beyond the simple "good job" and help your report grow professionally by showing what could be done differently
- 360-model performance review includes input from colleagues, other reports to that person, as well as a self-review
- Writing a summary review for a report is a chance to look at the bigger picture and notice trends in their development over a period of time
    - Devote enough time: digest peer reviews, form your own summary
    - Focus on the larger picture: don't keep just the last couple of months in mind
    - Provide specific examples, excerpts from peer reviews
    - Don't skip over the good stuff: celebrate achievements with ample praise
    - Stay focused when it comes to corrective feedback: review constructive feedback from peers and ensure it's valuable to your report before sharing it and not just a grudge against them
- _"What about the case where you have very little meaningful feedback for
improvement? This indicates that the person is ready to be promoted or given
more challenging work"_
- Convey expectations prior to review (for e.g. inform underperformers in advance)
- For scored reviews, prepare with examples why the person is scoring less than a perfect score as it can be an uncomfortable discussion
- As a manager you'll play a key role in promoting your reports, and presenting their case to upper management or a committee
- _"Many companies expect you to be acting at the next level before you get promoted to it. This practice exists to prevent the “Peter Principle,” in which people are promoted to their level of incompetence."_
- Firing an underperformer is probably one of the more challenging tasks for a manager
- Usually, HR processes will put the employee on a _performance improvement plan_, which is a set of clearly defined objectives that the person must achieve within a fixed period of time
- _"Depending on the company, such a plan might actually be an effort to turn an employee around, but often the plan is written in such a way that the person can’t possibly hope to achieve the goals in the allotted time, and it’s just a generous way of giving someone time to look for another job before being fired."_
- Make it clear early and often if a report is not performing at the expected level so there are no surprises, and keep records of the feedback delivered

## Managing a Team [&#8593;](#table-of-contents)

- _"If you truly wish to command the respect of an engineering team, they must see you as technically credible. It’s hard to make up lost time when you stop writing code, and if you do it too early in your career, you may never achieve sufficient technical savvy to get beyond the role of middle management."_
- Look out for dysfunctions in teams:
    - Not shipping frequently: this can hint at multiple reasons like inadequate tooling and automation, or not breaking down work into smaller pieces properly
    - People drama: talk to vocally negative people that the behavior has to change, bring clear examples, and provide corrective feedback quickly after things happen
    - Overwork: learn from crunch periods and try to prevent them - cut features if you can, and push back on unrealistic deadlines
    - Collaboration issues: have productive conversations about improvements, encourage team bonding apart from work topics
- As a manager, you may be a shield but don't be a parent. Sometimes it is good to be transparent to the team about issues (layoffs, knock-on effects if a deadline isn't met etc.) if it provides additional context to their work.
- Make data-driven decisions on product features using measures such as time taken to complete features, numbers of bugs found in Q/A or time spent dealing with outages
- Look into the future of the product roadmap when making technical decisions. Review the efficiency of the decisions made to learn from past decisions
- _"Conflict-avoidant managers tend to favor harmony above functional working relationships. Creating a safe environment for disagreement to work itself out is far better than pretending that all disagreement does not exist."_
- Tips on managing conflict:
    - Don't rely solely on voting, as everyone involved may not be impartial to the various outcomes
    - A clear set of processes for decision making can depersonalize decisions
    - You should be aware of any issues within the team in advance
    - Don't blame problems on other teams
    - _"Your goal as a manager, however, should not be to be nice, it should be to be kind."_
- _"The best way to avoid brilliant jerk syndrome is to simply not hire one."_
- Project Management rules of thumb:
    - _"Don’t expect to get more than 10 weeks’ worth of focused effort on the main projects per team member per quarter"_
    - _"Budget 20% of time for generic sustaining engineering work across the board (testing, debugging, cleaning up legacy code)"_
    - _"As you approach deadlines, it is your job to say no"_
    - _"Use the doubling rule for quick estimates, but push for planning time to estimate longer tasks"_
    - _"Be selective about what you bring to the team to estimate"_

## Managing Multiple Teams [&#8593;](#table-of-contents)

- At this point, it becomes difficult to keep writing code with the same frequency as a tech lead or team manager
- Code reviews, debugging, and prod support are good ways to stay engaged with the codebase
- _"I advocate strongly that you spend the time to gain mastery of programming before moving into management. For me, this took about 10 years, including my undergraduate and graduate degrees."_
- For efficient time management, break down tasks into four categories:


|               |   Not Urgent  |  Urgent |
|---------------|:-------------:|--------:|
| Important     |               |         |
| Not Important |               |         |


- Attend internal meetings where possible to gauge team morale, track progress on deliverables
- Decide how to delegate work effectively:


|               |   Frequent               |  Infrequent                      |
|---------------|:------------------------:|---------------------------------:|
| Simple        |   Delegate               |     DIY                          |
| Complex       |   Delegate (carefully)   | Delegate for training purposes   |

- _"Are your teams learning how to operate independently, or are you keeping them dependent on you for critical functions?"_
- Learn when to say "No":
    - Use the "Yes, and" technique to respond with positivity instead of saying "no" directly
    - Create policies to outline requirements that must be met to say "yes" (such as switching to a new programming language)
    - Adopt a "help me say yes" attitude and dig into suggestions with follow-up questions
    - Lay out the workload and budget to the team to show there is little room to maneuver
    - When you know you need to decline, it's best to do it quickly. Remain open to apologizing and learning from your mistake if you were wrong
- _"These health signals — frequency of code releases, frequency of code check-ins, and infrequency of incidents — are the key indicators of a team that knows what to do, has the tools to do it, and has the time to do it every day."_
- Overfocusing on prevention of incidents is almost as detrimental as releasing unstable code in that both reduce your team's ability to produce their best possible work
- _"Durable teams are built on a shared purpose that comes from the company itself, and they align themselves with the company’s values"_
    - Durable teams are resilient to the loss of individual team members
    - Open to new ideas and value changes if this serves the purpose better
    - Understand that peers across the company are your 'first-team' and not just your direct reports
- Channel the traits of “laziness, impatience, and hubris” into advantanges
    - _"Be impatient to figure out the nut of what’s important. As a leader, any time you see something being done that feels inefficient, question it."_
    - _"Go home! And stop emailing people at all hours of the night and all hours of the weekend!"_


## Managing Managers [&#8593;](#table-of-contents)

- As a new manager in this role, keep in touch more frequently with all teams (even those outside your skillset) as you can't sense intuitively (yet) where things may be going off the rails
- _"The open-door policy is nice in theory, but it takes an extremely brave engineer to willingly take the risk of going to her boss (or especially her boss’s boss, etc.) to tell him about problems."_
- Skip-level meetings (short 1-on-1s, perhaps each quarter) are a critical way to build a relationship with the developers who report to your managers. Suggested prompts:
    - What do you like best/worst about the project you are working on?
    - Do you have any feedback about your manager — what’s going well, what isn’t?
    - Are there any opportunities you think we might be missing?
    - How do you think the organization is doing overall? Anything we could be doing better/more/less?
    - Are there any areas of the business strategy you don’t understand?
- Note that skip-level meetings don't scale well, and will potentially have to be abandoned if the organization grows by a large figure (thousands of employees)
    - One way around this could be informal team lunches once or twice a quarter to get some feedback from groups and observe team dynamics
- _"Skip-level meetings are a chance to hear the other side of the story, to get a reality check from the people on the ground."_
- Managers reporting to you are responsible for the success of the team even when external factors are affecting them, such as:
    - Unstable product roadmap, frequent requests for changes
    - Errant tech lead who goes down rabbit holes
    - Full time firefighting to maintain stability of systems, constant requests from other divisions for support
- People pleasing managers can be of two types:
    - team pleasers play therapist, can amplify drama, be well-liked amongst colleagues and may never get around to fixing all the problems
    - external pleasers shield upper management from issues within the team, and avoid having serious conversations with their team members
- _"When you’re managing a people pleaser, one of the best things you can do is show the person that he’s exhibiting the behavior, and highlight the downsides."_
- _"A new manager who is working all the time is probably failing to hand off her old responsibilities to other people on her team, and so she’s attempting to do two jobs at once."_
- A manager who dominates decision making is just as bad as a manager overworking herself
- _"Making the wrong person a manager is a mistake, but keeping her in that position once you’ve realize she’s wrong for it is a critical error."_
- Leverage professional training programs and conferences to train new managers in technical leadership
- It is vital for managers to be a "culture-fit" because they create sub-cultures within their teams, and an alignment of subcultures is required for teams to work well together
    - _"It’s easier to gain access to industry information than it is to retrain someone who doesn’t know how to work in your culture."_
- Few ways to test potential new managerial hires:
    - Role-play 1-on-1s
    - Role-play difficult situations like dealing with an underperforming employee
    - Ask behavioural questions about past experienced running behind schedule on projects
    - Deliver a presentation to a group of people to check her structuring of thoughts, command of the room, and ability to speak up in front of an audience
    - Design / system architecture questions
    - _"Do thorough reference checks for anyone you’re planning to bring on board, even if you’ve worked with that person before."_
- Great managers share their drive to uncover the "why" behind problems with great debuggers
    - Devise a hypothesis about why the team is having issues
    - Check team chats, emails, logs, calendars - are they collaborating well together? Too many meetings?
    - Observe team meetings, see if all members are involved
    - Ask the team about their goals, and clarity around why they have these goals
    - Make note of team dynamics and whether the members have a degree of personal connection with each other
    - Jump in to help if the manager is struggling
    - _"Without the drive to understand why, we rely on charm and luck to see us through our management careers and to make our hiring and firing decisions."_
- _"Engineers often don’t want to estimate at all, or estimate beyond the boundary of an agile sprint (generally two weeks)...Estimates are still useful as they"_
    - convey feature complexity to the rest of the team
    - help businesses predict costs and effort
    - teach engineers to better understand the complexity of their software
- _"When estimates are wrong, what are we learning about unknown complexity? What are we learning about what is worth estimating, when? What are we learning about how we communicated those estimates and who was disappointed by the miss?"_
    - Keep the client updated with any changes to the timeline
    - Show empathy to others and shift focus from blame to action
    - Work with managers and tech leads to cut scope
- Roadmap uncertainty is a common problem across companies:
    - Be prepared for changes given the size and state of your company
    - Break down big projects into smaller deliverables, so you can complete parts of it if not the entire vision
    - Don't overpromise future projects to the team when the roadmap isn't set in stone
    - Dedicate 20% of the team's time to "sustaining engineering" (refactoring, bug fixes, cleanup, improving processes)
    - Understand the value proposition of the various projects to decide which work is worth the effort
- _"Projects change. Teams may even be disbanded or moved around in ways that you don’t understand or agree with. As a manager, the best thing you can do is help people feel capable of tying up loose ends, stabilizing the current in-flight projects, and easing into their new work in a controlled fashion. This is an area where you can and should push back."_
- It is important to remain technically relevant as you:
    -  oversee technical investment into systems in terms of new frameworks, languages, and infrastructure
    -  ask informed questions to guide technical investment
    -  understand (and explain) business tradeoffs, by identifying difficult features and unforeseen business implications
    -  make specific requests of engineers and explain limitations to senior management
-  How to remain technically relevant?
    - Look over pull requests occasionally, spot places where the code may have become ugly
    - Pick an unknown area and ask an engineer to explain it to you
    - Attend postmortems and sprint retrospectives
    - Keep up with industry trends and modern tooling
    - Create a network of technical peers in engineering and engineering management outside the company
    - Never stop learning  

## The Big Leagues [&#8593;](#table-of-contents)

- _"In his book High Output Management, Andy Grove breaks down management tasks into four general categories:"_
    - Information gathering: meetings, emails, one-on-ones, gathering perspectives
    - Nudging: gently reminding people of commitments to guide them in a direction without force
    - Decision making: balancing different perspectives and taking responsibility for decisions made, especially if they turn out poorly
    - Role modeling: Honour commitments, set an example for your team
- Taxonomy of senior leadership roles
    - R&D: focuses on expanding the use of cutting edge technology at the company
    - Tech strategy: uses business and tech trends to guide decisions, often owns product development
    - Organization: ensures adequate staffing
    - Execution: helps plan roadmap, work, coordinate large efforts, prioritize
    - Face of tech: senior leader to participates in conferences, client meetings to promote the product
    - Technical Ops Manager: responsible for infrastructure - might be cost / security / scale focused
    - Business executive: understands the industry and business functions at a high level
- VP of Engineering:
    - Usually the top end of management career for engineers
    - Screens and hires new talent, maps development roadmap to hiring strategy
    - In-charge of day-to-day operations of the teams
    - Has a stake in organizational strategy, helping teams set goals to achieve business deliverables
- CTO:
    - _"Not a role most people who love coding, architecture, and deep technical design would enjoy doing."_ 
    - _"CTO should be the strategic technical executive the company needs in its current stage of evolution."_
    - Must understand the business and be able to shape the strategy through technological lens
    - Protects the technology team from being purely an execution arm for company strategy, allowing room for their own tasks and ideas
- Priorities can change, companies can decide to change focus and take on a new direction. It is your job to communicate this effectively to the team, and give them the time they need if they're working on finishing other work that is critical, such as stabilising a system, or a months-long project very close to completion.
- Creating a technology strategy:
    - Research current pain points, expected growth areas for senior management, current tech landscape and expected changes
    - Combine research and ideas to draft a rough outline of the future
    - Plan actionable ideas around points from earlier steps to grow the business and expand product features
    - Prepare the presentation based on the Board's preferred communication style (e.g. sparse details on slides)
    - _"The hardest part, in many ways, was getting started. The second-hardest part was getting comfortable making a guess about the future with highly imperfect information."_
-  Communicating bad news (layoffs, change in strategy) can be challenging as a manager:
    - Don't send an impersonal message to the entire group at once, they deserve to hear it coming from you personally
    - Try to tailor the news individually for people expected to be most affected
    - If you can't stand behind the message, don't force yourself to deliver it. Ask someone else to step in.
    - Be honest about the likely outcomes
    - Think about how you would like to be told, and follow that
- It can be isolating to be the only engineer on a senior leadership team
    - Disagreements with cross-functional peers should be taken up in 1-on-1s or leadership team meetings
    - _"Disagreements that happen in the context of the leadership team don’t exist to the wider team."_
- As a senior leader, you need to detach from your engineering team
    - You're likely to be perceived as playing favourites if you are too close to the team
    - Leading effectively requires people to take your words seriously, and they're less likely to do so if you maintain a "buddy" image
- Be careful not to cultivate a culture of fear where engineers are reprimanded publicly for mistakes
- "True North" is the core role of a senior leader in their area (CTO for tech, CFO for finance and so on): to set a baseline of what excellence in their area looks like     

## Bootstrapping Culture [&#8593;](#table-of-contents)

- _"If you want to create healthy teams, you need to have a sense of what is important to you, to your company, and to your growing group of colleagues."_
- Early startups often forego traditional structure in favour of quicker decisions. Unstructured groups can work in certain circumstances, as described by Jo Freeman in a [feminist talk](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm) at the Southern Female Rights Union in the 70s: 
    - the group has a specific task as its focus
    - the group is relatively small and homogenous, as too great a diversity in a task-oriented group can bring about miscommunication
    - the group has a high degree of communication
    - the group has a low degree of skill specialisation, making everyone capable of contributing
- Structure is necessary to take on complex tasks - for instance, without structure, many early-stage startups suffer from spaghetti code
- Structure must not come too early (imagine a group of five reporting to each other in a hierarchy) or too late (single decision maker continues to make calls and change his mind frequently even as the company scales)
- The number of people at the company, its age, the industry it operates in (regulated / unregulated) determine its structure
- _"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work."_ (John Gall, _Systemantics)_
- _"Culture is the generally unspoken shared rules of a community."_
- _"It is to your advantage to create a culture that allows for bringing a broader range of people into your community. “Engineers who graduated from MIT” is not a culture."_
- While we don't generally agree with every value held by our own friends and family, the more core values that overlap between you and the company you work for, the easier you'll find it to function at work, fit in, and feel accepted.
- Applying culture:
    - identify your values - subteams may have slightly different cultures (some are professional and work at strict times, others prefer late starts and avenues to hang out socially)
    - reinforce culture by rewarding those who exhibit your values
    - learn to spot those who may have a value misalignment, and coach them to overcome it where appropriate (for e.g. someone might be shy and reluctant to participate in a culture of shoutouts and positive company-wide recognition for colleagues)
    - avoid hiring based on a "friendship" test - humans form friendships with those from a similar background (race, class, schooling etc) and while this shortcut may seem appealing it doesn't usually come with the values you would want in a strong team
- Creating cultural policy documents can be a tough task, and what works for one company doesn't always translate directly to another
