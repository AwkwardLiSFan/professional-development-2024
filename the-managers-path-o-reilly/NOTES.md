Notes and quotes from the book [The Manager's Path - A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change (O'Reilly)](https://www.amazon.com.au/Manager%60s-Path-Camille-Fournier/dp/1491973897)

## Management 101
- 1-on-1 Meetings
    - For individual contributors, 1-on-1s with their managers should not be used as status meetings
    - Take initiative to craft an agenda for these meetings
- Training
    - Most often, you hold responsibility for upskilling in desired areas
    - _"Whether you are brand new to the workplace or 20 years into your career,
the onus of figuring out what you want to do, what you want to learn, and what
will make you happy rests on your shoulders."_

## Mentoring
- Mentoring Interns
    - Many companies match new interns and grads with an existing employee as mentor
    - Usually a safe way of learning how to manage someone else
    - Listen beyond just language and pay attention to mentee's body language, eye contact
    - Set clear goals and milestones for interns, encourage research and problem solving on their own before seeking your help
- Mentoring Grads
    - _"Effective teams have good onboarding documents they provide to new hires.
Things like step-by-step guides to setting up their development environments,
learning how tracking systems work, and familiarizing themselves with the tools
they will need for the job are crucial for new hires."_
    - Don't forget to introduce new grads to your network within the company
- Beware the following red flags in managers:
    - undermines teammates, belittles mistakes
    - redoes the work of colleagues without warning
    - takes credit for team work
- Managing mentors
    - Figure out why a mentoring relationship is required in the first place
    - _"These programs can be nice, but often the mentor and mentee are
given very little guidance beyond the fact that they have been matched together."_
    - Recognise the additional effort required on the part of the mentor
    - Do not expect women to only mentor women, and men to only mentor men,
people of color (PoC) to only mentor other PoC unless the purpose of the mentoring program is driven from a
diversity focus
- Hiring Interns
    - Don't hire an intern who is not close to graduation - interns are a way to attract and retain top talent, look for someone closer to committing to their first full-time role
    - Hiring interns is relatively easier - you can push for hiring candidates from underrepresented groups
