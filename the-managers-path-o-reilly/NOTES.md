# Overview
Notes and quotes from the book [The Manager's Path - A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change, Camille Fournier (O'Reilly)](https://www.amazon.com.au/Manager%60s-Path-Camille-Fournier/dp/1491973897)

## Management 101
- 1-on-1 Meetings
    - For individual contributors, 1-on-1s with their managers should not be used as status meetings
    - Take initiative to craft an agenda for these meetings
- Training
    - Most often, you hold responsibility for upskilling in desired areas
    - _"Whether you are brand new to the workplace or 20 years into your career,
the onus of figuring out what you want to do, what you want to learn, and what
will make you happy rests on your shoulders."_

## Mentoring
- Mentoring Interns
    - Many companies match new interns and grads with an existing employee as mentor
    - Usually a safe way of learning how to manage someone else
    - Listen beyond just language and pay attention to mentee's body language, eye contact
    - Set clear goals and milestones for interns, encourage research and problem solving on their own before seeking your help
- Mentoring Grads
    - _"Effective teams have good onboarding documents they provide to new hires.
Things like step-by-step guides to setting up their development environments,
learning how tracking systems work, and familiarizing themselves with the tools
they will need for the job are crucial for new hires."_
    - Don't forget to introduce new grads to your network within the company
- Beware the following red flags in managers:
    - undermines teammates, belittles mistakes
    - redoes the work of colleagues without warning
    - takes credit for team work
- Managing mentors
    - Figure out why a mentoring relationship is required in the first place
    - _"These programs can be nice, but often the mentor and mentee are
given very little guidance beyond the fact that they have been matched together."_
    - Recognise the additional effort required on the part of the mentor
    - Do not expect women to only mentor women, and men to only mentor men,
people of color (PoC) to only mentor other PoC unless the purpose of the mentoring program is driven from a
diversity focus
- Hiring Interns
    - Don't hire an intern who is not close to graduation - interns are a way to attract and retain top talent, look for someone closer to committing to their first full-time role
    - Hiring interns is relatively easier - you can push for hiring candidates from underrepresented groups

## Tech Lead
- No one-size-fits-all definition for this role
    - Tech leads continue to write code, represent their team to management, vet feature delivery plans and deal with project management
    - _"A leader, responsible for a (software) development team, who spends at
least 30 percent of their time writing code with the team."_ (Talking with Tech Leads, Patrick Kua)
-  Not a point on the ladder, but a set of responsibilities that senior engineers can take on at any stage
-  Balancing technical feature delivery and project management tasks can be difficult at first
    - Avoid meetings which are not required
    - Ensure that others respect your team's focus and set up their calendar's accordingly
- Main roles of a tech lead:
    - Systems architect and business analyst: understand business requirements, translate into software. Devise architecture of the overall system and provide time estimates.
    - Project planner: identify priorities and find efficient ways of breaking down the work so that the team
can work quickly.
    - Software developer and team leader: continue writing code, but not too much. Raise issues early without shame. Delegate work efficiently.
- Project planning
    - _"Doesn’t agile software development get rid of the need for project manage-
ment? No."_
    - Doesn't need to happen in detail for every effort, but a sound round of planning can prevent slow failure of the project
    - _"Ultimately, the value of planning isn’t that you execute the plan perfectly,
that you catch every detail beforehand, or that you predict the future; it’s that you
enforce the self-discipline to think about the project in some depth before diving
in and seeing what happens."_
- Five step approach to project management
    - Break down deliverables into smaller blocks of work in a spreadsheet / Gantt chart
    - Push through unknowns until maximum value has been extracted from planning
    - Keep stakeholders updated of status throughout project, adjust plan as you go
    - Manage requirements changes, be clear about cost of changes
    - Revisit close to completion, perform a pre-mortem (an exercise where you go through all the things that could fail on the
launch of this big project)
- At one point you will have to decide between the technical track and the management track
    - Reality rarely matches up to expectations with both roles
    - There are pros and cons to each, try both and pick one that you enjoy the most
- Process Czars
    - _"The process czar believes that there is one true process that, if implemented correctly and followed as designed, will solve all of the team’s biggest problems."_
    - The opposite of this is a manager who realises that processes should meet the needs of the team and the project
    - Strive for self-regulating processes (i.e. automation)
    - Be honest and make it clear to the team that it is okay to fail
- Being a Great Tech Lead
    - _"It’s almost impossible to lead
projects well when you don’t understand the architecture you’re changing."_
    - Learn the nuances of the architecture if you don't understand it
    - Be a team player, encourage others to learn the entire system and handle a variety of tasks
    - _"Determine which decisions must be made by you, which decisions should be
delegated to others with more expertise, and which decisions require the whole
team to resolve."_
    - _"Write design documents and get feedback on them from better writers. Write blog posts for your tech blog or your personal blog. Speak in team meetings, speak at meetups, and get practice standing up in front of an audience."_

## Managing People

- Build trust and rapport using questions for a new report
    - How do you like to be praised, in public or in private?
    - What is your preferred method of communication for serious feedback?
Do you prefer to get such feedback in writing so you have time to digest it,
or are you comfortable with less formal verbal feedback?
    - Do you have any clear career goals that I should know about so I can help
you achieve them?
- Create a 30/60/90 day plan
    - Can help detect mishires quickly
    - Create realistic milestones based on prior hires, the current state of your technology and project, and the level of the person coming in
- _"A best practice in many engineering teams is to create a set of onboarding documents that are edited by every new hire as he gets up to speed"_
- Communicate working style and expectations around frequency of check-ins, deliverables etc.
- Get as much feedback as you can from the new hire in the first 90 days on established processes and potential improvements
- Schedule weekly 1-on-1s. Some questions to consider which can alter the frequency:
    - How often do you interact with this person offhand during the week?
    - How much coaching does this person need?
    - How much does this person push information up to you?
    - How stable or unstable are things in the team or the company?
- 1-on-1s can be of many types: formal to-do lists for discussion, informal catch-ups, occasional feedback / coaching sessions, and progress updates for managers of managers
- For each person you manage, maintain a running shared document of notes, takeaways, and to-dos from your 1-1s.
- Practical advice for delegating
    - Ensure team has valid goals to measure success against, use these to understand what details are important to dig into
    - Look at the version control systems or tickets for information, subscribe to any available alerts and examine the metrics
    - Different details are the priority at different project stages (good system design and goal-setting at first, progress details towards the end) - focus on the right detail at the right stage
    - Establish standards for code and systems (unit test coverage, linting, review of major technical decisions)
    - Treat openly shared information, good or bad, in a positive manner (for instance, a struggling colleague doesn't reveal this until late in the project)
