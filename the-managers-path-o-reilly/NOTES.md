## Management 101 [&#8593;](#table-of-contents)
- 1-on-1 Meetings
    - For individual contributors, 1-on-1s with their managers should not be used as status meetings
    - Take initiative to craft an agenda for these meetings
- Training
    - _"Whether you are brand new to the workplace or 20 years into your career,
the onus of figuring out what you want to do, what you want to learn, and what
will make you happy rests on your shoulders."_

## Mentoring [&#8593;](#table-of-contents)
- Mentoring Interns
    - Many companies match new interns and grads with an existing employee as mentor
    - Usually a safe way of learning how to manage someone else
    - Listen beyond just language and pay attention to mentee's body language, eye contact
    - Set clear goals and milestones for interns, encourage research and problem solving on their own before seeking your help
- Mentoring Grads
    - _"Effective teams have good onboarding documents they provide to new hires.
Things like step-by-step guides to setting up their development environments,
learning how tracking systems work, and familiarizing themselves with the tools
they will need for the job are crucial for new hires."_
    - Don't forget to introduce new grads to your network within the company
- Beware the following red flags in managers:
    - undermines teammates, belittles mistakes
    - redoes the work of colleagues without warning
    - takes credit for team work
- Managing mentors
    - Figure out why a mentoring relationship is required in the first place
    - _"These programs can be nice, but often the mentor and mentee are
given very little guidance beyond the fact that they have been matched together."_
    - Recognise the additional effort required on the part of the mentor
    - Do not expect women to only mentor women, and men to only mentor men, people of color (PoC) to only mentor other PoC unless the purpose of the mentoring program is driven from a diversity focus
- Hiring Interns
    - Don't hire an intern who is not close to graduation - interns are a way to attract and retain top talent, look for someone closer to committing to their first full-time role
    - Hiring interns is relatively easier - you can push for hiring candidates from underrepresented groups

## Tech Lead [&#8593;](#table-of-contents)
- No one-size-fits-all definition for this role
    - Tech leads continue to write code, represent their team to management, vet feature delivery plans and deal with project management
    - _"A leader, responsible for a (software) development team, who spends at least 30 percent of their time writing code with the team."_ (Talking with Tech Leads, Patrick Kua)
-  Balancing technical feature delivery and project management tasks can be difficult at first
    - Avoid meetings which are not required
    - Ensure that others respect your team's focus and set up their calendar's accordingly
- Main roles of a tech lead:
    - Systems architect and business analyst: understand business requirements, translate into software. Devise architecture of the overall system and provide time estimates.
    - Project planner: identify priorities and find efficient ways of breaking down the work so that the team can work quickly.
    - Software developer and team leader: continue writing code, but not too much. Raise issues early without shame. Delegate work efficiently.
- Project planning
    - _"Doesn’t agile software development get rid of the need for project manage-
ment? No."_
    - _"Ultimately, the value of planning isn’t that you execute the plan perfectly,
that you catch every detail beforehand, or that you predict the future; it’s that you
enforce the self-discipline to think about the project in some depth before diving
in and seeing what happens."_
- Five step approach to project management
    - Break down deliverables into smaller blocks of work in a spreadsheet / Gantt chart
    - Push through unknowns until maximum value has been extracted from planning
    - Keep stakeholders updated of status throughout project, adjust plan as you go
    - Manage requirements changes, be clear about cost of changes
    - Revisit close to completion, perform a pre-mortem (an exercise where you go through all the things that could fail on the launch of this big project)
- Process Czars
    - _"The process czar believes that there is one true process that, if implemented correctly and followed as designed, will solve all of the team’s biggest problems."_
    - The opposite of this is a manager who realises that processes should meet the needs of the team and the project
    - Strive for self-regulating processes (i.e. automation)
    - Be honest and make it clear to the team that it is okay to fail
- Being a Great Tech Lead
    - _"It’s almost impossible to lead projects well when you don’t understand the architecture you’re changing."_
    - Be a team player, encourage others to learn the entire system and handle a variety of tasks
    - _"Determine which decisions must be made by you, which decisions should be delegated to others with more expertise, and which decisions require the whole team to resolve."_
    - _"Write design documents and get feedback on them from better writers. Write blog posts for your tech blog or your personal blog. Speak in team meetings, speak at meetups, and get practice standing up in front of an audience."_

## Managing People [&#8593;](#table-of-contents)

- Build trust and rapport using questions for a new report
    - How do you like to be praised, in public or in private?
    - What is your preferred method of communication for serious feedback?
Do you prefer to get such feedback in writing so you have time to digest it,
or are you comfortable with less formal verbal feedback?
    - Do you have any clear career goals that I should know about so I can help
you achieve them?
- Create a 30/60/90 day plan
    - Can help detect mishires quickly
    - Create realistic milestones based on prior hires, the current state of your technology and project, and the level of the person coming in
- _"A best practice in many engineering teams is to create a set of onboarding documents that are edited by every new hire as he gets up to speed"_
- Communicate working style and expectations around frequency of check-ins, deliverables etc.
- Get as much feedback as you can from the new hire in the first 90 days on established processes and potential improvements
- Schedule weekly 1-on-1s. Some questions to consider which can alter the frequency:
    - How often do you interact with this person offhand during the week?
    - How much coaching does this person need?
    - How much does this person push information up to you?
    - How stable or unstable are things in the team or the company?
- 1-on-1s can be of many types: formal to-do lists for discussion, informal catch-ups, occasional feedback / coaching sessions, and progress updates for managers of managers
- For each person you manage, maintain a running shared document of notes, takeaways, and to-dos from your 1-1s
- Creative, talented team members flourish with sufficient autonomy. Delegate effectively, but don't confuse this with abdicating responsibility
- Practical advice for delegating
    - Ensure team has valid goals to measure success against, use these to understand what details are important to dig into
    - Look at the version control systems or tickets for information, subscribe to any available alerts and examine the metrics
    - Different details are the priority at different project stages (good system design and goal-setting at first, progress details towards the end) - focus on the right detail at the right stage
    - Establish standards for code and systems (unit test coverage, linting, review of major technical decisions)
    - Treat openly shared information, good or bad, in a positive manner (for instance, a struggling colleague doesn't reveal this until late in the project)
- Adopt a culture of frequent feedback in the team, praising the good and correcting the bad without waiting for the annual reviews
    - Know your team: ask them about their ambitions, current level, strengths, weaknesses
    - Observe your team: try to recognise one positive trait in your colleague each week. Don't spend all your time trying to correct weakness as that can come off as undue criticism.
    - Give regular, lightweight feedback: positive feedback makes it easier for colleagues to digest corrective feedback when required
    - Provide coaching: Go beyond the simple "good job" and help your report grow professionally by showing what could be done differently
- 360-model performance review includes input from colleagues, other reports to that person, as well as a self-review
- Writing a summary review for a report is a chance to look at the bigger picture and notice trends in their development over a period of time
    - Devote enough time: digest peer reviews, form your own summary
    - Focus on the larger picture: don't keep just the last couple of months in mind
    - Provide specific examples, excerpts from peer reviews
    - Don't skip over the good stuff: celebrate achievements with ample praise
    - Stay focused when it comes to corrective feedback: review constructive feedback from peers and ensure it's valuable to your report before sharing it and not just a grudge against them
- _"What about the case where you have very little meaningful feedback for
improvement? This indicates that the person is ready to be promoted or given
more challenging work"_
- Convey expectations prior to review (for e.g. inform underperformers in advance)
- For scored reviews, prepare with examples why the person is scoring less than a perfect score as it can be an uncomfortable discussion
- As a manager you'll play a key role in promoting your reports, and presenting their case to upper management or a committee
- _"Many companies expect you to be acting at the next level before you get promoted to it. This practice exists to prevent the “Peter Principle,” in which people are promoted to their level of incompetence."_
- Firing an underperformer is probably one of the more challenging tasks for a manager
- Usually, HR processes will put the employee on a _performance improvement plan_, which is a set of clearly defined objectives that the person must achieve within a fixed period of time
- _"Depending on the company, such a plan might actually be an effort to turn an employee around, but often the plan is written in such a way that the person can’t possibly hope to achieve the goals in the allotted time, and it’s just a generous way of giving someone time to look for another job before being fired."_
- Make it clear early and often if a report is not performing at the expected level so there are no surprises, and keep records of the feedback delivered

## Managing a Team [&#8593;](#table-of-contents)

- _"If you truly wish to command the respect of an engineering team, they must see you as technically credible. It’s hard to make up lost time when you stop writing code, and if you do it too early in your career, you may never achieve sufficient technical savvy to get beyond the role of middle management."_
- Look out for dysfunctions in teams:
    - Not shipping frequently: this can hint at multiple reasons like inadequate tooling and automation, or not breaking down work into smaller pieces properly
    - People drama: talk to vocally negative people that the behavior has to change, bring clear examples, and provide corrective feedback quickly after things happen
    - Overwork: learn from crunch periods and try to prevent them - cut features if you can, and push back on unrealistic deadlines
    - Collaboaration issues: have productive conversations about improvements, encourage team bonding apart from work topics
