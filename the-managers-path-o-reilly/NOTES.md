# Overview
Notes and quotes from the book [The Manager's Path - A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change (O'Reilly)](https://www.amazon.com.au/Manager%60s-Path-Camille-Fournier/dp/1491973897)

## Management 101
- 1-on-1 Meetings
    - For individual contributors, 1-on-1s with their managers should not be used as status meetings
    - Take initiative to craft an agenda for these meetings
- Training
    - Most often, you hold responsibility for upskilling in desired areas
    - _"Whether you are brand new to the workplace or 20 years into your career,
the onus of figuring out what you want to do, what you want to learn, and what
will make you happy rests on your shoulders."_

## Mentoring
- Mentoring Interns
    - Many companies match new interns and grads with an existing employee as mentor
    - Usually a safe way of learning how to manage someone else
    - Listen beyond just language and pay attention to mentee's body language, eye contact
    - Set clear goals and milestones for interns, encourage research and problem solving on their own before seeking your help
- Mentoring Grads
    - _"Effective teams have good onboarding documents they provide to new hires.
Things like step-by-step guides to setting up their development environments,
learning how tracking systems work, and familiarizing themselves with the tools
they will need for the job are crucial for new hires."_
    - Don't forget to introduce new grads to your network within the company
- Beware the following red flags in managers:
    - undermines teammates, belittles mistakes
    - redoes the work of colleagues without warning
    - takes credit for team work
- Managing mentors
    - Figure out why a mentoring relationship is required in the first place
    - _"These programs can be nice, but often the mentor and mentee are
given very little guidance beyond the fact that they have been matched together."_
    - Recognise the additional effort required on the part of the mentor
    - Do not expect women to only mentor women, and men to only mentor men,
people of color (PoC) to only mentor other PoC unless the purpose of the mentoring program is driven from a
diversity focus
- Hiring Interns
    - Don't hire an intern who is not close to graduation - interns are a way to attract and retain top talent, look for someone closer to committing to their first full-time role
    - Hiring interns is relatively easier - you can push for hiring candidates from underrepresented groups

## Tech Lead
- No one-size-fits-all definition for this role
    - Tech leads continue to write code, represent their team to management, vet feature delivery plans and deal with project management
    - _"A leader, responsible for a (software) development team, who spends at
least 30 percent of their time writing code with the team."_ (Talking with Tech Leads, Patrick Kua)
-  Not a point on the ladder, but a set of responsibilities that senior engineers can take on at any stage
-  Balancing technical feature delivery and project management tasks can be difficult at first
    - Avoid meetings which are not required
    - Ensure that others respect your team's focus and set up their calendar's accordingly
- Main roles of a tech lead:
    - Systems architect and business analyst: understand business requirements, translate into software. Devise architecture of the overall system and provide time estimates.
    - Project planner: identify priorities and find efficient ways of breaking down the work so that the team
can work quickly.
    - Software developer and team leader: continue writing code, but not too much. Raise issues early without shame. Delegate work efficiently.
- Project planning
    - _"Doesn’t agile software development get rid of the need for project manage-
ment? No."_
    - Doesn't need to happen in detail for every effort, but a sound round of planning can prevent slow failure of the project
    - _"Ultimately, the value of planning isn’t that you execute the plan perfectly,
that you catch every detail beforehand, or that you predict the future; it’s that you
enforce the self-discipline to think about the project in some depth before diving
in and seeing what happens."_
- Five step approach to project management
    - Break down deliverables into smaller blocks of work in a spreadsheet / Gantt chart
    - Push through unknowns until maximum value has been extracted from planning
    - Keep stakeholders updated of status throughout project, adjust plan as you go
    - Manage requirements changes, be clear about cost of changes
    - Revisit close to completion, perform a pre-mortem (an exercise where you go through all the things that could fail on the
launch of this big project)
- At one point you will have to decide between the technical track and the management track
    - Reality rarely matches up to expectations with both roles
    - There are pros and cons to each, try both and pick one that you enjoy the most
- Process Czars
    - _"The process czar believes that there is one true process that, if implemented cor-
rectly and followed as designed, will solve all of the team’s biggest problems."_
    - The opposite of this is a manager who realises that processes should meet the needs of the team and the project
    - Strive for self-regulating processes (i.e. automation)
    - Be honest and make it clear to the team that it is okay to fail
- Being a Great Tech Lead
    - _"It’s almost impossible to lead
projects well when you don’t understand the architecture you’re changing."_
    - Learn the nuances of the architecture if you don't understand it
    - Be a team player, encourage others to learn the entire system and handle a variety of tasks
    - _"Determine which decisions must be made by you, which decisions should be
delegated to others with more expertise, and which decisions require the whole
team to resolve."_
    - _"Write design documents
and get feedback on them from better writers. Write blog posts for your tech blog
or your personal blog. Speak in team meetings, speak at meetups, and get prac-
tice standing up in front of an audience."_
